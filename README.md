# Why do I code?
The answer won't be so simple. 

I like the thrill of trying if something I've created is running as supposed.

I love chalenges and solving puzzles connected to programming task.

When I have really interesting problem to solve I can't stop thinking how to break it.

And lastly I love to learn new things and coding gives me opportunity to do so.
